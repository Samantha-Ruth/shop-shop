# shop-shop
An e-commerce store with all types of products. 


This e-commerce store was built using React, and used the React Context API.  In order to complete this project, Redux-like actions and reducers were written and tested, and a global state was inacted across multiple React components.  This projected used IndexeddB within a React component and cached server-side data to this IndexedDB to ensure the app works properly when the internet connection is compromised.
