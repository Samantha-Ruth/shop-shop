# shop-shop
An e-commerce store with all types of products. 

## Description
This e-commerce store was built using the MERN stack, including node.js, express, MongoDB, Mongoose and GraphQL as backend technologies, ApolloServer, and React and the React Context API as well as javascript and css for front-end technologies.  In order to complete this project, Redux-like actions and reducers were written and tested, and a global state was inacted across multiple React components.  This projected used IndexedDB within a React component and cached server-side data to this IndexedDB to ensure the app works properly when the internet connection is compromised. Finally, this store employed the use of the Stripe API to safely accept and handle payments. * Note- this is a sample store, so items are not for sale and the payment page is an example. *
